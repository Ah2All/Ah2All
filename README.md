<strong>Hi there 👋 Im Alireza</strong>

### 💢 About Me :
> My name is Alireza Allahyarian and I am a penetration tester and security researcher with 5 years of experience in the cybersecurity industry. I started my career as a web developer and after two years, discovered my passion and enthusiasm for cybersecurity, becoming a junior penetration tester.
In 2022, I founded a cybersecurity company called Grey Cube with the aim of providing security services such as red teaming and penetration testing on a freelance basis, as well as creating a platform for expanding cyber knowledge and fostering a suitable work environment.
I am currently working as a senior web penetration tester
